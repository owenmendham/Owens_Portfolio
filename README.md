-Code was then written in SQL to give players numerical values of their contribution to games based on 5 categories

-The ranks system was then used in SQL to find outliers based on in-game contributions compared to salary paid

-Lastly, calculated team totals and referenced them with real-life wins count to ensure accuracy
